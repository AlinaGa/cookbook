                <ul>
                    <li>~ 18 pieces of falafel (6 per person)</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
                    <li>1 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
                    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 mild red chilli, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon ginger paste (or fresh minced ginger)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
                    <li>400 g tin (~ 1 ⅓ cups) chopped tomatoes</li>
                    <li>400 ml (~ 1 ½ cups) tinned coconut milk</li>
                    <li>Large handful fresh spinach</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Black pepper</li>
                </ul>

                <ol>
                    <li>Bake the falafel according to the instructions on the packet - it should take around 20 minutes. Make sure it's nice and crispy.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, heat a dash of oil in a deep frying pan, and add the sliced onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook over a medium heat for around 5 minutes, until the onion has softened. Add the turmeric and garam masala, and cook for a few minutes more. You can add a dash of water if the mixture feels too dry - it should be the texture of a paste.</li>
                    <li>Next add the tin of chopped tomatoes and the coconut milk, and bring to a gentle simmer. Leave it to cook for a while - the exact timing doesn't really matter, but at least 10 minutes or so will give a nice rich sauce (a bit longer is fine too!).</li>
                    <li>Add a handful of spinach to the sauce, and allow it to wilt for a couple of minutes, then add the crispy falafel. Stir gently to coat the falafel in the sauce, season to taste, and serve immediately.</li>
