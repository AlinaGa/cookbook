  <h2>Falafel Curry</h2>
  <p>
    This falafel curry is a brilliant way to serve falafel, coated in a
    creamy, spicy sauce - it makes such a hearty, filling curry! Perfect
    served over rice or with naan bread for dipping.

          <li>~ 18 pieces of falafel (6 per person)</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
          <li>1 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
          <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
          <li>1 mild red chilli, finely chopped</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon ginger paste (or fresh minced ginger)</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
          <li>400 g tin (~ 1 ⅓ cups) chopped tomatoes</li>
          <li>400 ml (~ 1 ½ cups) tinned coconut milk</li>
          <li>Large handful fresh spinach</li>

          <li>
            Bake the falafel according to the instructions on the packet - it
            should take around 20 minutes. Make sure it's nice and crispy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, heat a dash of oil in a deep frying pan, and add the
            sliced onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook over a medium heat for
            around 5 minutes, until the onion has softened. Add the turmeric
            and garam masala, and cook for a few minutes more. You can add a
            dash of water if the mixture feels too dry - it should be the
            texture of a paste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next add the tin of chopped tomatoes and the coconut milk, and
            bring to a gentle simmer. Leave it to cook for a while - the exact
            timing doesn't really matter, but at least 10 minutes or so will
            give a nice rich sauce (a bit longer is fine too!).
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a handful of spinach to the sauce, and allow it to wilt for a
            couple of minutes, then add the crispy falafel. Stir gently to
            coat the falafel in the sauce, season to taste, and serve
            immediately.
          </li>
        </ol>
